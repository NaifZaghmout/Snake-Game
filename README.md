## Description

Snake Game is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the play field to eat apples. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the play field.

The game is built in Python and uses the `pytimedinput` library for input with a timeout, `colorama` for terminal text color, and `random` for generating random positions.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
*  pip install pytimedinput colorama

4. Run the game:

* python snake_game.py

5. Use the following keys to control the snake:

* w: Move the snake up.
* a: Move the snake left.
* s: Move the snake down.
* d: Move the snake right.
* q: Quit the game.

6. Try to eat as many apples as possible and avoid hitting the boundaries or the snake's body.

7. After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again. Enter Y to play again or N to quit the game.
